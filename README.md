**GitHub Documentation for XOR Binary Operation and Cryptanalysis Tool**
This repository hosts a Python script designed to perform various operations related to XOR binary manipulations and basic cryptanalysis techniques. It is primarily focused on operations involving binary strings and offers a range of functionalities from simple XOR operations to more complex tasks such as key recovery and brute force methods in the context of one-time pad systems with key reuse.

**Installation**
To use this script, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone [repository URL]
Make sure Python is installed on your system. This script is compatible with Python 3.x.

**Usage**
Run the script using Python:

bash
Copy code
python xor_cryptanalysis.py
Main Features
Simple XOR of Binary Numbers: Perform an XOR operation between two binary strings.

Key Recovery Process for One-Time Pad with Key Reuse: This function aids in the key recovery process for scenarios where a one-time pad has been reused, compromising its security.

Brute Force Method on Ciphertexts: This feature allows for a brute force attack on ciphertexts with a known plaintext, useful in scenarios where the key length is relatively short.Contribution
